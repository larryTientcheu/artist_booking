Fyyur
-----

## Introduction

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

## Overview

This project can do the following using a PostgreSQL database:

* creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.
* searching for venues and artists.
* learning more about a specific artist or venue.

We want Fyyur to be the next new platform that artists and musical venues can use to find each other, and discover new music shows. Let's make that happen!(Joke)

## Tech Stack (Dependencies)

### 1. Backend Dependencies
Our tech stack will include the following:
 * **virtualenv** as a tool to create isolated Python environments
 * **SQLAlchemy ORM** to be our ORM library of choice
 * **PostgreSQL** as our database of choice
 * **Python3** and **Flask** as our server language and server framework
 * **Flask-Migrate** for creating and running schema migrations
You can download and install the dependencies mentioned above using `pip` as:
```
pip install virtualenv
pip install SQLAlchemy
pip install postgres
pip install Flask
pip install Flask-Migrate
```

### 2. Frontend Dependencies
You must have the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** with [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/) for our website's frontend. Bootstrap can only be installed by Node Package Manager (NPM). Therefore, if not already, download and install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Windows users must run the executable as an Administrator, and restart the computer after installation. After successfully installing the Node, verify the installation as shown below.
```
node -v
npm -v
```
Install [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/) for the website's frontend:
```
npm init -y
npm install bootstrap@3
```

#### Data Handling with `Flask-WTF` Forms
The starter codes use an interactive form builder library called [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/). This library provides useful functionality, such as form validation and error handling. You can peruse the Show, Venue, and Artist form builders in `forms.py` file. The WTForms are instantiated in the `app.py` file. For example, in the `create_shows()` function, the Show form is instantiated from the command: `form = ShowForm()`. To manage the request from Flask-WTF form, each field from the form has a `data` attribute containing the value from user input. For example, to handle the `venue_id` data from the Venue form, you can use: `show = Show(venue_id=form.venue_id.data)`, instead of using `request.form['venue_id']`.


1. **Install the dependencies:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the development server:**
```
export FLASK_APP=myapp
export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
python3 app.py
```
